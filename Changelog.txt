== libgcal 0.9.6 (2010-09-07) ==

- fixed premature libxml2 cleanup, which could cause crashes in applications

- added website examples

- added gcal_final_cleanup()

- restored ABI (I hope so!)

- both cmake and autotools should install in $INCLUDE_DIR/libgcal
  (this should make packagers life easier)

- IM support


== libgcal 0.9.4 (2010-06-09) ==

  nickname, blog, structured address. Patch by Holger Kral <holger.kral@gmx.net>

- Adding support for multiple email adresses and cellphones patch by
Stefano Avallone <stavallo@unina.it> and Andre Loureiro
<loureiro.andrew@gmail.com>>

== libgcal 0.9.3 (2009-08-26) ==

- Patch for encoding user name and password (if the user is using non
  ASCII characters) by lemma.


== libgcal 0.9.2 (2009-07-27) ==

- workaround for change in gcalendar (normalizes edit_url for added X
retrieved event). Details here:
http://groups.google.com/group/google-calendar-help-dataapi/browse_thread/thread/a5cb021dd6fa5d9c/3443b934a6da0948?lnk=gst&q=alternate+link#3443b934a6da0948

== libgcal 0.9.1 (2009-06-22) ==

- support for hosted accounts (based on contribution by Morpheuz)

- small leak fix


== libgcal 0.9 (2009-04-22) ==

- porting to google data protocol 2.0;

- support for more contacts fields. Currently supported fields are:
  name, email, telephone, job title, organization, address, notes, photo;

- support for retrieve/add/edit contact's photos;

- cmake based buildsystem (probably will migrate away from autotools
  in next release). For while, both are shipped;

- small changes to make it compile/run happily with a C++ application;

- fix for non-ordered operations (I was testing sequence:
  add/edit/delete). Non-ordered operations trigged a bug where
  operations would fail because default package header was not correct;

- fix for using correct atom feed url for contacts;

- workaround for really weird situation where google calendar server
  answers requests directly *without* a redirect (reported by Tasaki,
  I was not able to reproduce the error but the code has some
  workaround for that);

- fixing a potential SEGFAULT condition (where a failed XPath
  expression could set a DOM node to NULL). Never happened, but
  fortune favors the prepared;

- fix for deleted flag (it was not being setted always, made a valid
  contact appear as deleted);


== libgcal 0.8 (2008-10-03) ==

- support to store and access RAW XML of each entry;

- add/edit/delete contacts/events using only XML (this makes easier to
integrate libgcal with other projects that uses a XML format to represent data);

- updated contacts now are returned ordered;

- added code to let you known if a returned entry was deleted from
server (useful when implementing synchronization software and doing a
query for updated events);

- support to http proxy;

- support for Mac OSX Leopard (should compile on FreeBSD too);

- doxygen documentation in all functions;

- improvement in unit test execution (you can now select which test
suite to run from command line);

- more unit tests and bug fixes;


== libgcal 0.7 (2008-06-27) ==

- authentication

- get all events/contacts

- atom stream parsing

- access to individual events/contacts

- add/delete/edit

- query for updated events/contacts
