libgcal changelog
Adenilson Cavalcanti (adenilson.silva@indt.org.br)

== libgcal 0.9 (2009-04-20) ==

- porting to google data protocol 2.0;

- support for more contacts fields. Currently supported fields are:
  name, email, telephone, job title, organization, address, notes, photo;

- support for retrieve/add/edit contact's photos;

- cmake based buildsystem (probably will migrate away from autotools
  in next release). For while, both are shipped;

- small changes to make it compile/run happily with a C++ application;

- fix for non-ordered operations (I was testing sequence:
  add/edit/delete). Non-ordered operations trigged a bug where
  operations would fail because default package header was not correct;

- fix for using correct atom feed url for contacts;

- workaround for really weird situation where google calendar server
  answers requests directly *without* a redirect (reported by Tasaki,
  I was not able to reproduce the error but the code has some
  workaround for that);

- fixing a potential SEGFAULT condition (where a failed XPath
  expression could set a DOM node to NULL). Never happened, but
  fortune favors the prepared;

- fix for deleted flag (it was not being setted always, made a valid
  contact appear as deleted);


== libgcal 0.8 (2008-10-03) ==

- support to store and access RAW XML of each entry;

- add/edit/delete contacts/events using only XML (this makes easier to
integrate libgcal with other projects that uses a XML format to represent data);

- updated contacts now are returned ordered;

- added code to let you known if a returned entry was deleted from
server (useful when implementing synchronization software and doing a
query for updated events);

- support to http proxy;

- support for Mac OSX Leopard (should compile on FreeBSD too);

- doxygen documentation in all functions;

- improvement in unit test execution (you can now select which test
suite to run from command line);

- more unit tests and bug fixes;


== libgcal 0.7 (2008-06-27) ==

- authentication

- get all events/contacts

- atom stream parsing

- access to individual events/contacts

- add/delete/edit

- query for updated events/contacts
