== libgcal 0.8 (2008-10-03) ==

- support to store and access RAW XML of each entry;

- add/edit/delete contacts/events using only XML (this makes easier to
integrate libgcal with other projects that uses a XML format to represent data);

- updated contacts now are returned ordered;

- added code to let you known if a returned entry was deleted from
server (useful when implementing synchronization software and doing a
query for updated events);

- support to http proxy;

- support for Mac OSX Leopard (should compile on FreeBSD too);

- doxygen documentation in all functions;

- improvement in unit test execution (you can now select which test
suite to run from command line);

- more unit tests and bug fixes;
