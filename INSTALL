cavalcantii@gmail.com

== Compile and install ==

Dependencies: gcc, automake, libxml-dev, libcurl-dev, ca-certificates


In the project root directory, run:

$autoreconf -i -f

$mkdir build #its a good practice not polute source directory
       	     #with binary objects

$cd build

$../configure

$make

$sudo make install



== Development ==

Dependencies: lcov, gcov, check, doxygen, dot

Do the same but you can also add:

$../configure --enable-devel #enable unit tests and other flags


**Attention**: There is an issue with efence in Ubuntu Hardy (mprotect fails),
you should run instead

**$../configure --enable-warnings --enable-check --enable-lcov**




$make lcov #runs unit test and create coverage reports

$make doxygen #generates API documentation


ps1: If you wish just to run just a suite case, set GCAL environment
variable (core|user|xml|screw) and GCALTEST variable for core module
testing (gcal|xpath|edit|contact|debug|query).


ps2: you can format this document to HTML running

$txt2tags -t html INSTALL


ps3: ATTENTION utest will not run on source directory.

ps4: Currently I have being using cmake as the official development buildsystem
(just run: make build; cd build; cmake ..; make)

ps5: Libgcal is already included in major Linux distros (Debian, OpenSuse,
Ubuntu, etc) and FreeBSD
